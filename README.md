# Ameriguesser
A spin-off of worldle (the game where you guess various countries), but instead with the states of the USA. I play these guessing games like Wordle and Worldle a lot
and decided I could make something like that no sweat. Completely original work. Small project just to refresh my web-development fundamentals and to have a little fun.

# How it works
- Just run the html and guess away!
